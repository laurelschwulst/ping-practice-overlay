        <div class="large-text">
          Certain ideas sing. They resonate in our bodies, touch some invisible
          place within.
        </div>

        <p>
          Sometimes we encounter these ideas out in the world. Other times, we
          hear them in our minds. Sometimes they are language, other times
          feelings or thoughts. Whatever they are — they’re meaningful energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Ping Practice universe, we call these resonances “Pings”.
          <sup>1234</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          What – if anything – these “Pings” might mean and how we might use
          them is rarely clear in the moment. Their meaning often unfolds and
          evolves over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fleeting nature of these Pings, and the uncertainty of their
          significance, can make deciding if and where to hold them (and how to
          work with them) unclear.
        </p>
        <p>Ping Practice emerged precisely from this place.</p>
        <p>
          Ping Practice is a journaling <a href="method.html">method</a> and
          <a href="app.html">app</a> designed to help you synthesize these
          fleeting bits of resonance into wisdom you are inspired and equipped
          to embody.
        </p>
        <p>
          The method emerged through <a href="https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/experiments:">years of experimentation</a> orbiting a central
          question:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >How might I locate what I learn and experience in ways that equip
            me to apply them in the fleeting moments when I sense opportunities
            to do so?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Ping Practices continues to be shaped by an <a href="https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/references">expansive body of
          pre-existing thought</a> and through conversations with
          <a href="people.html">people</a> who see making-meaning from what they
          experience as an act of survival.
