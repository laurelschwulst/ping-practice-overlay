      <h2>Ping</h2>
      <p>
        Ping Practice assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and
        easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues to new meaning and
        insight. Let's call these "Pings." [ii]
      </p>
      <p>
        A ping can take on any form: word, phrase, title, rhyme, name, lyric,
        quote, place, color, texture, melody, idea, feeling, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing about Pings – and what differentiates them from
        other thoughts – is that a Ping is language that moves you, "clicks," or
        otherwise causes you to feel something in your body.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are likely encountering a Ping if the attraction or resistance you
        sense seems intuitive, automatic, reflexive, and happens without
        thinking...as if what you are encountering touches something latent
        within you.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice</h2>

      Ping Practice is a 5-step method.

      <ol>
        <li>
          The first step is <b class="step">Sense</b>.<br /><br />
          <i
            >This means being aware and present so that you can notice things
            that "Ping" something within you.</i
          >
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The second step follows quickly after the first:
          <b class="step">Name</b><br /><br />
          <!-- <i
            >Translating – no matter how rough – what Pinged for you and holding
            this ping in the place where you've put all of the other pings
            you've logged before.</i
          ><br /><br /> -->
          To name is to externalize the Ping in a way that your future self can
          find its way back to the place in your mind-body where you first
          noticed it.<br /><br />
          The most important thing in this moment is to relieve yourself of
          needing to know:<br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li><i>What – if anything – might this “Ping” mean?</i></li>
            <br />
            <li><i>How – if at all – you might use this Ping?</i></li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          …the ensuing steps will help you arrive at answers to the above.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The third step is to <b class="step">Revisit</b> previous Pings.
          <br /><br />
          <!-- <i
            >The cadence with which you revisit can vary. The most important
            thing is that you engage with your collection. This could mean:</i
          ><br /><br /> -->
          <i
            >How and when you revisit will vary. The most important thing is
            that you:</i
          ><br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              <u>Afford</u> yourself the space to explore and respond to past Pings in a way that feels true to "where" you are in that moment.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          The fourth step is <b class="step">Create</b>.<br /><br />
          The purpose of Ping Practice is to turn the little things you notice
          (Pings) into insights that you can apply/act on. A core part of the
          "applying" part is making sure Pings are easy for you to Remember in
          the small windows you have opportunities to apply them.<br /><br />
          This means two things:<br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Making Pings that are important to you memorable so that you can
              quickly recall them and
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Locating these Pings in places where you will you be able to
              easily "reach" for them when you sense opportunities to act from them
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The last step – before the Ping Practice cycle repeats itself — is
          <b class="step">Embody</b>.<br /><br />
          Taking the insights you have converged on and acting on them. Doing so
          will cause you to Notice new things which starts the cycle all over
          again.
        </li>
      </ol>
